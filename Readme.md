### 1.1 Use Case Introduction
We will work with the California Housing Price dataset made available for you in a csv file. Thisdataset was based on data from the 1990 California census. It is not exactly recent, but it hasmany qualities for learning and is a popular dataset for introducing machine learning, so we willpretend it is recent data.

### Objectives
The task you are asked to perform is to build a model of housing prices in California using the California census data. This data has features such as population, median income, median housingprice and so on for each district in California. Your model should learn from this data and be able to predict the median housing price in anydistrict, given all other attributes.
